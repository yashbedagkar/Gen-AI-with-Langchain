Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep\\'s wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a stool or a tree stump or a gate (e.g., a wicket gate) as the wicket.\\n\\n\\n=== First definite reference ===\\n\\nIn 1598, a court case in England concerning an ownership dispute over a plot of common land in Guildford, Surrey, mentions the game of creckett. A 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, testified that he and his school friends had played creckett on the site fifty years earlier when they attended the Free School. Derrick\\'s account proves beyond reasonable doubt that the game was being played in Surrey circa 1550, and is the earliest universally accepted reference to the game.\\nThe first reference to cricket being played as an adult sport was in 1611, when two men in Sussex were prosecuted for playing cricket on Sunday instead of going to church. In the same year, a dictionary defined cricket as a boys\\' game, and this suggests that adult participation was a recent development. In an account of a case brought before the King\\'s Bench in 1640, it is recorded that a cricket match \"between the Weald & Upland\" took place \"about 30 yeares [sic]\" previously.\\n\\n\\n=== Derivation of the name of \"cricket\" ===\\nA number of words are thought to be possible sources for the term \"cricket\". In the earliest definite reference, it was spelled creckett. The name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch krick(-e), meaning a stick; or the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff, or the French word criquet meaning a wooden post. The Middle Dutch word krickstoel means a long low stool used for kneeling in church; this resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket. According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of the University of Bonn, \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., \"with the stick chase\").\\nIt is more likely that the terminology of cricket was based on words ')]"

            "A number of words are thought to be possible sources for the term \"cricket\". In the earliest definite reference, it was spelled creckett. The name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch krick(-e), meaning a stick; or the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff, or the French word criquet meaning a wooden post. The Middle Dutch word krickstoel means a long low stool used for kneeling in church; this resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket. According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of the University of Bonn, \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., \"with the stick chase\").\n",
            "It is more likely that the terminology of cricket was based on words ...\n"
